## Visualizing Sorts

From the homepage, click <b>Start Now</b> to go to the sort visualization page. Here, you'll see two sliders. The first controls the number of elements to be sorted. The second slider controls the initial randomness of the list. A value of 1 will create a completely random list, while a value of 5 will create a near perfect list of descending values.
