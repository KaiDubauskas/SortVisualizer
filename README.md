## Visualizing Sorts

From the homepage, click <b>Start Now</b> to go to the sort visualization page. Here, you'll see two sliders. The first controls the number of elements to be sorted. The second slider controls the initial randomness of the list. A value of 1 will create a completely random list, while a value of 5 will create a near perfect list of descending values. 

## Improvements and Future Projects

- Using native Javascript severely limited the tools I had to animate. Using outside packages would have increased efficiency, code-readibility, and saved time. 

- I could have used a framework like <b>React</b> to handle dependencies and make coding in javascript easier. Specifically, using React components would have made the website more dynamic and ready for expansion. CSS frameworks like <b>Bootstrap</b> could be used to enrich the user experience.

- In the future, I could expand the number of sorting algorithms such as <b>quick sort</b> and <b>merge sort</b> which are the two most popular sorting algortihms because of their O(nlogn) runtime.
